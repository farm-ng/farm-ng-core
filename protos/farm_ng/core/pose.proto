  // Example 1:
  //    If 'b' is the robot and 'a' is world (world_from_robot), this is the linear velocity of the robot.
  //    x is moving forward, y laterally left, & z up. All without regard for heading / orientation.
  // Example 2:
  //    If 'b' is a tool and 'a' is the robot, this represents the actuation of the tool.
  //    The directions are in the tools axes, but the movement is relative to the robot's body.
  //    If the tools convention is that x points down, then lowering the tool would be
  //    a positive x velocity, and any driving / turning of the robot would not be included.
